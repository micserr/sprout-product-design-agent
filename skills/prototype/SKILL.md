  Turns wireframes into a fully interactive Vue 3 prototype that users can feel, navigate, and
  experience. Use when converting wireframes to a clickable prototype, making screens interactive,
  building a prototype for user testing, or preparing frontend-ready code from a design workflow.
  Trigger phrases: "prototype", "make it interactive", "bring it to life", "clickable prototype",
  "wire the screens together", "add interactions", "turn wireframes into a prototype".

## Overview

This skill takes wireframe `.vue` files (from the wireframing skill) and produces a runnable,
interactive Vue 3 prototype. The output is a `prototype/` directory — multiple screens connected
by real navigation, with actual design system components, live state, and meaningful interactions.

**Input:** Wireframes in `wireframes/` + `DESIGN_SYSTEM` context + Phase 3 user flow diagram
**Output:** Runnable `prototype/` directory

**Scope:**
- Frontend only — no backend calls, no real APIs
- State via `ref`/`reactive` for local state, Pinia only if state is shared across screens
- Focus on experience: interactions, transitions, realistic content, edge states

---

## Step 0 — Pre-flight Check

Before reading wireframes or writing any code, verify the project environment using the confirmed `// Stack:` context. Run each check against the actual project files. If a check does not apply to the confirmed stack, skip it with a one-line note.

| # | Check | What to verify |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **CSS pipeline consistency** | Does the build tool config match the CSS syntax in the project's stylesheet? Flag if a v3-style `tailwind.config.js` + postcss plugin exists alongside v4 `@import 'tailwindcss'` syntax, or vice versa. Fix before proceeding. |
| 2 | **Source scanning completeness** | Does the bundler scan every directory containing component files? Verify that `wireframes/`, `prototype/`, and any directory outside the default source root is included in `@source` directives (v4) or `content` globs (v3). Add missing entries before proceeding. |
| 3 | **Package compatibility** | Are all design system packages compatible with the confirmed framework and CSS version? Check for peer dependency conflicts (e.g. a design system that pins `tailwindcss@^3` installed alongside v4). Uninstall incompatible packages before proceeding. |
| 4 | **Explicit dependencies** | Are routing and state management packages explicitly declared in `package.json`? Never assume transitive dependencies — if the prototype needs `vue-router` or `pinia`, they must be listed directly. Install any missing explicit deps before proceeding. |

Do not advance to Step 1 until all applicable checks pass.

## Step 1 — Read the Wireframes

Before writing a single line of prototype code, read every file in `wireframes/`.

For each wireframe extract:
- **Screen name and role** — what this screen does in the flow
- **Layout regions** — which sections are navigation, content, actions, sidebars
- **User actions** — buttons, links, form inputs, toggles — anything a user can interact with
- **Navigation triggers** — which actions should move to another screen

Then re-read the Phase 3 user flow diagram. Map every wireframe to a node in the flow. If a
wireframe doesn't appear in the flow, flag it — it may be a secondary state of an existing screen
(e.g., empty state, error state, confirmation) rather than a standalone route.

---

## Step 2 — Read the Design System Guide

Check the `DESIGN_SYSTEM` value carried forward from the design brief:

- **Toge v1** → read `guide/toge-design-system-v1/README.md`
  - Use `spr-` prefixed components: `<spr-button>`, `<spr-input>`, `<spr-modal>`
  - Use `spr-` Tailwind tokens for color, typography, border-radius
- **Toge v2** → read `guide/toge-design-system-v2/README.md`
  - Components were pulled via `npx shadcn-vue@latest add https://toge-ds.azurewebsites.net/r/ui/[component].json`
  - Import from `@/components/ui/[component-name]`

**Hard rule:** Never use raw hex colors or grayscale placeholders from the wireframe.
Every color in the prototype must come from the design system.

**Token enforcement (Toge v2):** If `DESIGN_SYSTEM` is **Toge v2**, read `guide/toge-design-system-v2/tokens/token-mapping.yaml` before writing any component. Every default Tailwind color class (`bg-gray-*`, `text-gray-*`, `bg-red-*`, `bg-emerald-*`, `bg-blue-*`, `bg-yellow-*`, `bg-orange-*`) is a violation — replace it with the mapped token before committing output. The design system clears all default Tailwind colors (`--color-*: initial`) so these classes silently render nothing at runtime.

**Known naming collision (Toge v2):** Do not combine `text-base` with another font-size utility on the same element. The design system defines `.text-base` as `color: var(--text-base)` in `@layer components`, but Tailwind also defines `text-base` as `font-size: 1rem` in `@layer utilities`. The utilities layer wins for `font-size`, so `text-xs text-base` silently becomes 1rem. Use `text-base` alone when 1rem font-size is acceptable, or use `text-strong` / `text-weak` when a specific font-size is also needed.

**Token enforcement (Toge v1):** If `DESIGN_SYSTEM` is **Toge v1**, tokens use the `spr-` prefix. Read `guide/toge-design-system-v1/README.md` for the token list. No separate mapping file needed.

## Step 3 — Scaffold the Prototype

**First action — write the stack context header.** Before creating any files, write the confirmed stack as a comment on the first line of the prototype entry file (`main.js` or equivalent):

```js
// Stack: {STACK_FRAMEWORK} · {STACK_TAILWIND_VERSION} · {DESIGN_SYSTEM} · entry: {STACK_ENTRY_POINT}
```

Example:
```js
// Stack: Vue 3 · Tailwind v4 · Toge · entry: prototype/main.js
```

Every subsequent code generation step in this session reads this header first. If a new file needs to be generated mid-session, check this header before writing any class. The header is the anchor that prevents silent stack assumption.

Create this directory structure:

```
prototype/
├── App.vue              ← router root + persistent layout shell (sidenav, topbar if needed)
├── router.js            ← vue-router config; one named route per screen
├── stores/              ← Pinia stores (only if state is shared across 2+ screens)
│   └── use[Feature]Store.js
├── composables/         ← all mock data and reusable logic lives here
│   └── use[Feature].js
├── components/          ← shared UI pieces used in 2+ screens
│   └── [ComponentName].vue
└── screens/             ← one file per screen
    ├── 01-[screen-name].vue
    ├── 02-[screen-name].vue
    └── ...
```

**router.js pattern:**
```js
import { createRouter, createWebHashHistory } from 'vue-router'

const routes = [
  { path: '/', redirect: '/[first-screen]' },
  { path: '/[screen]', name: '[Screen]', component: () => import('./screens/01-[screen].vue') },
]

export default createRouter({ history: createWebHashHistory(), routes })
```

**App.vue pattern:**
```vue
<script setup>
import { RouterView } from 'vue-router'
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Persistent shell: sidenav, topbar, etc. -->
  <RouterView />
</template>
```

---

## Step 4 — Implement Each Screen

Work through screens in flow order (start → end). For each screen:

### Replace wireframe placeholders
- ALL CAPS labels → real product-specific text
- Grayscale placeholder blocks → actual design system components
- `bg-gray-*` color blocks → design system token classes
- Dashed border boxes → real content (charts can stay as styled placeholders if complex)

### Add interactions
Every user action identified in Step 1 must do something:
- **Navigation actions** → `router.push({ name: '...' })` or `<router-link>`
- **Form inputs** → bound to reactive state with `v-model`
- **Toggles, tabs, accordions** → local `ref` state
- **Destructive actions** → confirmation modal before executing
- **Submit / save** → show loading state (150ms min) then success feedback

### Add edge states
For each screen, implement the states the journey map flagged as pain points:
- **Empty state** — what the screen looks like before any data exists
- **Loading state** — skeleton or spinner while "fetching"
- **Error state** — what happens when something goes wrong
- **Success feedback** — snackbar, banner, or inline confirmation

### Transitions
Use `<Transition>` for:
- Modal/drawer open and close
- Panel slide-in (detail panels, side panels)
- Page-level route transitions (optional — `fade` is enough)

Do NOT add transitions to every element. Only where they communicate state change.

### Navigation
```vue
<!-- Correct -->
<router-link :to="{ name: 'ScreenName' }">Go to screen</router-link>
<button @click="router.push({ name: 'ScreenName' })">Continue</button>

<!-- Wrong -->
<a href="/screen">Go to screen</a>
```

## Code Quality Rules

These apply to every file in `prototype/`. The output must be clean enough for a Frontend Agent
to read and build production code from.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Single responsibility | If a component exceeds ~80 lines of template, extract a child component |
| Props typed | `defineProps` with JSDoc types or TypeScript interface |
| Events declared | `defineEmits(['event-name'])` for every custom event |
| No inline styles | Tailwind classes + design system tokens only |
| No hardcoded data | Mock data lives in composables, never inline in templates |
| Composables return reactive state | `return { items, isLoading, selectedItem }` — not raw arrays |
| Stores are lean | Pinia stores hold only cross-screen state; local UI state stays in the screen |

**Composable pattern:**
```js
// composables/useEmployees.js
import { ref } from 'vue'

const MOCK_EMPLOYEES = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Maria Santos', department: 'Engineering', status: 'active' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Juan dela Cruz', department: 'Design', status: 'on-leave' },
]

export function useEmployees() {
  const employees = ref(MOCK_EMPLOYEES)
  const selected = ref(null)
  const isLoading = ref(false)

  function select(employee) {
    selected.value = employee
  }

  return { employees, selected, isLoading, select }
}
```

## Prototype Conventions

- **Realistic content** — use plausible names, dates, amounts, and statuses. Not "John Doe", "01/01/2024", or "Lorem Ipsum".
- **No backend** — mock all data in composables. Simulate async with `setTimeout` (300–800ms) where latency would be visible.
- **Accessible markup** — `<button>` for actions, `<a>` or `<router-link>` for navigation, every `<input>` has a `<label>`.
- **Desktop-first** — design for 1280px+. No need to be fully responsive unless the brief specifies mobile.
- **Design tokens only** — no raw hex, no arbitrary Tailwind values (`text-[#333]` is a violation).

## Check-in

After all screens are implemented, list the output files with a one-line description of each.
Then use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "All [N] screens are wired up and interactive. Want to walk through any screen, adjust an
> interaction, or add a missing state before this is ready for frontend handoff?"
