# product-design-agent-promax

## What is this?

A collection of Claude Code skills and an agent for product designers. It covers the full product design workflow — from market research and problem framing through user journeys to wireframing — so you can invoke structured, repeatable design thinking directly from your terminal without switching tools or losing context.

## Skills included

| Skill | What it does | Trigger phrases |
|---|---|---|
| ux-market-research | Competitive analysis, market sizing, trend identification | "research competitors", "market analysis", "competitive landscape" |
| problem-framing | JTBD templates, opportunity trees, HMW statements | "frame the problem", "JTBD", "how might we", "problem statement" |
| wireframing | HTML wireframe templates for 6 layout patterns | "wireframe", "sketch a layout", "design a screen", "information architecture" |
| user-journey | Journey maps and user flow diagrams | "user journey", "user flow", "map the flow", "journey map" |

## The Product Design Agent

A dual-mode agent — acts as an advisor for design questions, or as an orchestrator that runs the full workflow (research → problem framing → user journey → wireframe) from a single product brief.

**Trigger phrases:** "design agent, here's my brief:", "run product design for", "review this design"

cd product-design-agent-promax

No need to re-run `install.sh` — symlinks update automatically.

## Adding More Skills

Skills are markdown files in `skills/`. To add a custom skill:

1. Create a new folder in `skills/` (e.g., `skills/my-skill`).
2. Add a `SKILL.md` inside it with YAML frontmatter containing at minimum a `name` and `description` field.
3. Run `./install.sh` to link it into `~/.claude/skills/`.
